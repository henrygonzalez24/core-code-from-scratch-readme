### Algorithm to prepare a pizza from scratch 🍕
```
1. Start
2. Have the pizza ingredients at hand.
3. Mix the flour, salt, sugar and olive oil with a mixer.
4. Knead the pizza dough for 7-10 minutes or until it is a little bit sticky.
5. Place the dough in a large bowl and let it wait between 2h and 24h.
6. Preheat the baking sheet.
7. Divide the dough into 2 round dough balls.
8. Take one ball of dough and flatten it so that it takes a circular shape.
9. Sprinkle the dough with flour.
10. Spread tomato sauce on top of the dough.
11. Place the cheese on top of the sauce.
12. Place any extra toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, or your choice of toppings.
13. Put the pizza in the oven.
14. Bake the pizza in the oven at a temperature of 475° F for 10 to 15 minutes.
15. Remove the pizza from the oven.
16. Wait for the pizza to cool and start tasting.
17. Finish.

### Algorithm that is able to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and viceversa. 🌡
```
1. Start
2. Display 2 options to the user, the first option would be to convert from Celsius to Farenheit and the second option is to convert from Farenheit to Celsius.
3. If the first option is chosen then continue to step 4 otherwise continue to step 8.
4. Prompt to enter the temperature in degrees Celsius.
5. The value obtained in step 4 is multiplied by 1.8.
6. The value obtained in step 5 is added with 32.
7. The result of the conversion in degrees Farenheit is displayed.
8. If the second option is chosen then proceed to step 9 otherwise end the algorithm.
9. Ask for the value of the temperature in degrees Farenheit.
10. The value obtained in step 9 is subtracted by 32.
11. The value obtained in step 10 is divided by 1.8.
12. The result obtained in step 11 is displayed.
13. Finish.
```
### Algorithm to calculate the volume of a pyramid, a cube and a sphere 📐
```
1. Start
2. Display 3 options to the user, the first option is to calculate the volume of a pyramid, the second option is to calculate the volume of a cube and the third option is to calculate the volume of a sphere.
3. If the first option is chosen then continue to step 4 otherwise continue to step 8.
4. Ask to enter the height of the pyramid.
5. Prompt to enter the area of the base of the pyramid.
6. The value obtained in step 5 is multiplied with 1/3 and also multiplied with the value obtained in step 4 and also multiplied with the value obtained in step 5.
7. The result obtained from step 6 is displayed.
8. If the second option is chosen then continue to step 9 otherwise continue to step 12.
9. Prompt to enter the value of the length of one of the sides of the cube.
10. The value obtained in step 9 is raised to 3.
11. The result obtained from step 10 is displayed.
12. If the third option is chosen then continue to step 13 otherwise end the algorithm.
13. Ask to enter the value of the radius of the sphere.
14. The value obtained in step 13 is raised to 3.
15. The value obtained in step 14 is multiplied with 4/3.
16. The value obtained in step 15 is multiplied with pi.
17. The result obtained from step 16 is displayed.
18. Finish.

### Numbers 📈
```
1. Start
2. Ask for a number.
3. The number obtained in step 2 is made a modular division with 2 and if its result is 0 then go to step 4, otherwise go to step 5.
4. Show that the number is even.
5. Show that the number is odd.
6. Finish.
```
The flowchart of the algorithm is the following:<br>

### How old are you? 👴
The algorithm is the following:
```
1. Start
2. Ask for the year of birth.
3. Subtract 2022 with the number obtained in step 2.
4. Show the result obtained in step 3.
5. Finish.
```

The pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:
```
año = 0
imprimir("¿Cuál es su año de nacimiento?")
leer(año)
edad = 2022 - año
imprimir("Su edad es: " + edad)
```

### Find the treasure 👑
Description: <br>
```
We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure.
Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them.
Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures.

Which chests have treasures?
```
Solution:

```
The left chest and the right chest have treasures.
```
